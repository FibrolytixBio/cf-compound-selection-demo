      "reasoning": "Tanespimycin demonstrates high potential efficacy for cardiac fibrosis, supported by strong literature evidence indicating that HSP90 inhibition effectively attenuates pro-fibrotic pathways and improves cardiac function in various models. However, this promising efficacy is severely counteracted by its high toxicity to normal human fibroblasts. With only 10% of cells remaining at a concentration 100 times higher than its reported IC50 for growth inhibition in normal fibroblasts, tanespimycin exhibits a highly unfavorable safety profile. For a chronic condition like cardiac fibrosis, a therapeutic agent must possess a wide therapeutic window and minimal off-target toxicity to preserve healthy tissue and ensure long-term patient safety. The severe cytotoxicity observed makes tanespimycin an unsuitable candidate for further development, despite its potent anti-fibrotic effects. Therefore, its overall priority is very low.",

Due to its involvement in extracellular matrix \n(ECM) remodelling, myofibroblast differentiation and apoptosis, HSP 90 has been \ninvestigated as a key player in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Idiopathic \npulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and deadly interstitial lung \ndisease, due to the progressive distortion of lung parenchyma related to the \noverproduction and deposition of altered ECM, driven by transforming growth \nfactor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) dependent and independent pathways. The inhibition or induction \nof HSP 90 is associated with a reduced or increased expression of TGF-\u03b2 \nreceptors, respectively, suggesting a role for HSP 90 as a biomarker and \ntherapeutic target in IPF. Experimental drugs such as geldanamycin and its \nderivatives 17-AAG (17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamicin) and 17-DMAG \n(17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxigeldanamycin), along with AUY-922, \n1G6-D7, AT-13387, TAS-116 and myricetin, have been found to reduce lung fibrosis \nin both in vivo and in vitro models, supporting the role of this emerging \ntarget. This review aims to illustrate the structure and biological function of \nHSP 90 in the context of IPF pathobiology, as well as perspective application of \nthis molecule as a biomarker and therapeutic target for IPF.\n\nCopyright \u00a9The authors 2025.\n\nDOI: 10.1183/16000617.0147-2024\nPMCID: PMC11920893\nPMID: 40107664 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: G.

In this study, \nwe investigated the role of LRP6 as a potential modulator of pressure \noverload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and elucidated the underlying molecular \nmechanisms. We performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce pressure \noverload in cardiomyocyte-specific LRP6 overexpression mice (LRP6-over\u00a0mice) and \nin control mice (\u03b1-myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-MHC) Mer-Cre-Mer Tg mice or named\u00a0MCM \nmice). Cardiac function and hypertrophy were assessed using echocardiography. \nLRP6-over mice showed improved cardiac function and reduced hypertrophy after \nTAC, compared with MCM mice. We also applied mechanical stretch to cultured \nneonatal rat cardiomyocytes to model pressure overload in vitro. Mass \nspectrometry analysis showed that LRP6 interacts with HSP90\u03b1 and cathepsin D \n(CTSD) in cardiomyocytes under mechanical stress. Further analysis demonstrated \nthat LRP6 facilitates CTSD-mediated degradation of HSP90\u03b1, consequently \ninhibiting \u03b2-catenin\u00a0activation and reducing cardiac hypertrophy post-TAC. \nTreatment with recombinant\u00a0HSP90\u03b1 protein or the CTSD inhibitor, pepstatin A, \npartly abolished the protective effect of LRP6 overexpression on myocardial \nhypertrophy and cardiac function after TAC in mice. Collectively, our data \nsuggest that LRP6 protects against pressure overload-induced myocardial \nremodeling and that the CTSD/HSP90\u03b1/\u03b2-catenin axis may be a potential \ntherapeutic target.\n\n\u00a9 2024.

Lean and ob/ob obese mice received chemical ER chaperone \ntauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 50\u00a0mg/kg/d, p.o.) for 35 days prior to \nevaluation of glucose sensitivity, echocardiographic, myocardial geometric, \ncardiomyocyte mechanical and subcellular Ca2+ property, mitochondrial integrity, \noxidative stress, apoptosis, and ferroptosis. Intracellular Ca2+ governing \ndomains including sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) were \nmonitored by45Ca2+uptake and immunoblotting. Our results noted that TUDCA \nalleviated myocardial remodeling (fibrosis, hypertrophy, enlarged LVESD), \nechocardiographic anomalies (compromised fractional shortening and ejection \nfraction), cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction (amplitude and velocity of cell \nshortening, relengthening time) and intracellular Ca2+ anomalies (compromised \nsubcellular Ca2+ release, clearance and SERCA function), mitochondrial damage \n(collapsed membrane potential, downregulated mitochondrial elements and \nultrastructural alteration), ER stress (GRP78, eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4), oxidative \nstress, apoptosis and ferroptosis [downregulated SLC7A11, GPx4 and upregulated \ntransferrin receptor (TFRC)] without affecting global glucose sensitivity and \nserum Fe2+ in obese mice. Obesity-evoked change in HSP90, phospholamban and \nNa+-Ca2+ exchanger was spared by the chemical ER chaperone. Moreover, in vitro \nresults noted that TUDCA, PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, TFRC neutralizing antibody \nand ferroptosis inhibitor LIP1 mitigated palmitic acid-elicited changes in lipid \nperoxidation and mechanical function. Our findings favored a role for \nferroptosis in obesity cardiomyopathy downstream of ER stress.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.

In our previous studies, we found that \ninhibition of Hsp90 delayed cardiac remodeling during the development of chronic \nheart failure in animal models. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, \nhas been shown to inhibit Hsp90. However, it is unclear whether simvastatin can \nprevent cardiac remodeling by inhibiting Hsp90. Therefore, the effects of \nsimvastatin were examined in a rat model of chronic heart failure following \nmyocardial infarction. The results showed that simvastatin reduced cardiac \nremodeling by inhibiting cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, simvastatin decreased \nthe expression of c-Raf and calcineurin, which are involved in intracellular \nsignaling during the development of myocardial remodeling. In\u00a0vitro, we found \nthat the interaction of Hsp90 with c-Raf and calcineurin was reduced and the \nexpression levels these client proteins were decreased in fibroblasts cultured \nin the presence of simvastatin. In addition, simvastatin also reduced \nproliferation, migration, and collagen production of fibroblasts. These results \nsuggest that Hsp90 inhibition is partly responsible for the inhibitory effect of \nsimvastatin on the development of myocardial remodeling.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

Hsp90 consists of \nthree structural domains: N-terminal, middle and C-terminal domains. Hsp90 has \nmany activities in numerous proteins and signaling pathways like chimeric fusion \nproteins, steroid hormone receptors, tumor suppressor genes, and cell cycle \nregulatory proteins. The role of Hsp90 is not only in cancer but also in other \ndiseases like COVID-19, leishmaniasis, diabetes, flavi virus, systemic \nsclerosis, grass carp reovirus, psoriasis, malaria, cardiac fibrosis, and \nalcohol-related liver diseases.

The extensive involvement in protein folding and regulation \nof protein stability within cells makes Hsp90 an attractive therapeutic target \nto correct multiple dysfunctions. Many of the clients of Hsp90 are found in \npathways known to be pathogenic in the heart, ranging from transforming growth \nfactor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) signaling to tumor necrosis \nfactor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), Gs and Gq g-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and calcium (Ca2+) \nsignaling. These pathways can therefore be targeted through modulation of Hsp90 \nactivity. The activity of Hsp90 can be targeted through small-molecule \ninhibition. Small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 have been found to be cardiotoxic \nin some cases however. In this regard, specific targeting of Hsp90 by modulation \nof post-translational modifications (PTMs) emerges as an attractive strategy. In \nthis review, we aim to address how Hsp90 functions, where Hsp90 interacts within \npathological pathways, and current knowledge of small molecules and PTMs known \nto modulate Hsp90 activity and their potential as therapeutics in cardiac \ndiseases.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/jpm11121373\nPMCID: PMC8709342\nPMID: 34945845\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n\n7.

Although it is assumed that the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL necroptotic pathway, which \ncomprises client proteins for Hsp90, is involved; however, the relationship \nbetween the cardioprotective effects of 17-AAG and the activity of the cardiac \nRIP1/RIP3/MLKL necrosome-associated proteins in the failing heart following \nmyocardial infarction remained unclear. Therefore, the levels of phosphorylated \nMLKL after myocardial infarction with or without Hsp90 inhibitor treatment were \nmeasured. Myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the coronary artery \n(CAL) in Wistar rats. 17-AAG was injected from the 2nd to the 8th week after \nmyocardial infarction. The administration of 17-AAG attenuated the cardiac \ndysfunction, hypertrophy, and fibrosis at the 8th week after CAL, simultaneously \nlessening the increases in the expression and phosphorylation levels of RIP1, \nRIP3, and MLKL in the area of the left ventricular muscle without infarct. These \nresults indicate that the activation of the RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway is a common \nevent in the development of chronic heart failure. Furthermore, our findings \nsuggest that the effects of 17-AAG treatment on the improvement of cardiac \nfunction in rats after myocardial infarction is related to the attenuation of \nthis RIP1/RIP3/MLKL pathway.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) exerts deleterious effects \nin some fibrotic diseases. S-nitrosylation (SNO) of HSP90 affects its own \nfunction. However, little is known about its role in pathological stress. Here, \nwe investigated the effect of SNO-HSP90 on cardiac fibrosis.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SNO-HSP90 level was measured by biotin-switch. SNO sites \nwere identified through mass spectrometry. S-nitrosylation site-mutated plasmids \nor adeno-associated virus, gene deletion, and pharmacological antagonists were \nused to identify the contribution of SNO-HSP90 to myocardial fibrosis.\nKEY RESULTS: SNO-HSP90 level was positively correlated with fibrosis marker \nexpression in hearts from patients and significantly higher in fibrotic hearts \nfrom spontaneously hypertensive rats and mice subjected to transverse aortic \nconstriction, as well as in angiotensin II- or isoprenaline-treated neonatal rat \ncardiac fibroblasts. S-nitrosylated site of HSP90 at cysteine 589 was \nidentified. Inhibition of SNO-HSP90 by Cys589 mutation reduced fibrosis in \nangiotensin II- or isoprenaline-treated cardiac fibroblasts. Administration of \nrecombinant adeno-associated virus of Cys589 mutation improved heart function \nand alleviated fibrosis in transverse aortic constriction mice. Mechanistically, \nSNO-HSP90 stimulated binding of TGF\u03b2 receptor 2 to HSP90, in response to \nfibrotic stimuli, followed by increased phosphorylation and nuclear \ntranslocation of SMAD3. Additionally, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) deficiency or \nthe iNOS inhibitor, 1400W, reduced SNO-HSP90 levels and activation of the \nTGF\u03b2/SMAD3 signalling pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SNO-HSP90 \nmitigates fibrosis through blocking the TGF\u03b2/SMAD3 signalling pathway, providing \na potential therapy for cardiac remodelling.\n\n\u00a9 2021 The British Pharmacological Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/bph.15626\nPMID: 34265086 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n9.

In this \npresent study, we investigated the effects of 17-AAG on cardiac fibrosis during \nthe development of heart failure. We used pressure-loaded cardiac hypertrophic \nmice prepared by constriction of the transverse aorta (TAC), which induces \nsignificant cardiac fibrosis without scar tissue. From the sixth week after the \nTAC operation, vehicle or 17-AAG was administered intraperitoneally twice a \nweek. Eight weeks after the operation, the vehicle-treated animals showed \nchronic heart failure. On the other hand, cardiac deterioration of the \n17-AAG-treated animals was attenuated. In 17-AAG-treated animals, when the \ndegree of fibrosis was observed by histological staining, their volume of \nfibrosis was found to be reduced. The content of calcineurin, an Hsp90 client \nprotein, and the level of dephosphorylated NFATc2, a transcription factor in the \ncardiac fibroblasts, in the TAC mice was reduced by treatment with 17-AAG. \nFurthermore, c-Raf and Erk signaling, indicators for cell proliferation and \ncollagen synthesis, was also attenuated. In in vitro experiments, the \nproliferation and collagen synthesis of the cultured cardiac fibroblasts were \nattenuated by the presence of 17-AAG. When cardiac fibroblasts were incubated \nwith angiotensin II, calcineurin-NFATc2 and c-Raf-Erk signaling in the cells \nwere activated. These activations were attenuated by 17-AAG. Our findings \nsuggest that suppression of the calcineurin-NFAT and c-Raf-Erk pathways may \npartially contribute to the attenuation of myocardial fibrosis caused by \ntreatment with 17-AAG. Therefore, our data imply that the Hsp90 inhibitor may \nhave potential for novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart \nfailure.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study investigated if \nendothelial cell (EC)-specific calpain participates in myocardial endothelial \ninjury via the endothelial- mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and in cardiac \nfibroblasts during cell proliferation, thereby contributing to cardiac fibrosis \neventually.\nMETHODS: in vitro cultured mouse cardiac ECs were induced with transforming \ngrowth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 (10 ng/ml) and calpain inhibitor III (20 \u03bcM) or Akt \ninhibitor (LY294002, 20 \u03bcM). Isolated cardiac fibroblasts were induced by TGF-\u03b21 \nand an HSP90 inhibitor (17AAG, 20 \u03bcM), and EndMT were analysed. Capn4-knockout \n(KO) specific to ECs of mice was generated. We induced the pathological process \nmimicking cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in both Capn4-KO mice and their \nwild-type littermates. The histological analysis was used to measure \ncardiomyocyte size and collagen contained in the heart. The immunofluorescence \nanalysis was performed to demonstrate that the ECs went through the EndMT, \ntransforming mesenchymal cells into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.\nRESULTS: Capn4 deletion specific to ECs abrogated activity of both calpain 1 and \ncalpain 2 in ECs, lowered the volume of cardiac collagen and cardiomyocytes \nsize, and ameliorated myocardial dysfunction in the isoproterenol-treated \ncardiac fibrosis model. An ex vivo analysis of cardiomyocytes by Evans Blue \nstaining revealed that isoproterenol increased cell death compared with the \ncontrol, and Capn4-KO alleviated this result. Inhibiting calpain in cultured \ncardiac microvascular endothelial cells (MCECs) reversed the EndMT process, \nwhich was induced by TGF-\u03b21. Overexpression of calpastatin decreased the \npathological EndMT process, showing that the cultured MCECs have more \nmesenchymal markers, such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and fewer endothelial \nmarkers, such as VE-cadherin. Activating calpain elevated phosphorylated Akt in \nmice cultured ECs, and inhibiting calpain decreased phosphorylated Akt. \nUpregulation of phosphorylated Akt by calpain promoted the EndMT, whereas \ninhibiting calpain switched on the protective mechanism during the EndMT via the \nheat shock protein (HSP)90/Akt signaling way in cultured ECs.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a vital role of calpain in ECs for inducing \nmyocardiocyte hypertrophy, cell death and the EndMT via the HSP90/Akt signaling \npathway, thereby promoting cardiac fibrosis. The results indicate that \ninhibiting ECs calpain is a novel therapeutic target to retard cardiac fibrosis \nand has positive effects on heart failure.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
