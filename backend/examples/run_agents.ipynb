I know that Luminespib is a potent HSP90 inhibitor. While I haven't found direct evidence for its use in cardiac fibrosis within the available databases, the mechanistic rationale is plausible. HSP90 is involved in signaling pathways relevant to fibrosis (e.g., TGF-beta).

      "    reasoning='Luminespib (also known as AUY922 or NVP-AUY922) is a potent, second-generation inhibitor of Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). My investigation confirms its primary target is HSP90-beta (CHEMBL4303) with a low nanomolar IC50.\\n\\nThe primary rationale for predicting its efficacy in reversing cardiac fibroblast activation is based on the central role of HSP90 in stabilizing numerous \"client\" proteins that are critical for pro-fibrotic signaling. Key pathways driving fibroblast activation and fibrosis, such as the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway, are highly dependent on HSP90. HSP90 chaperones and stabilizes TGF-β receptors and downstream signaling molecules like Smads. Inhibition of HSP90 leads to the degradation of these client proteins, thereby disrupting the pro-fibrotic signaling cascade. This disruption is expected to reduce the expression of fibrotic markers (e.g., alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen) and induce a morphological shift in activated fibroblasts towards a more quiescent-like state.\\n\\nHowever, a comprehensive search of PubChem bioassays and ChEMBL drug indications for Luminespib did not yield any direct preclinical data related to cardiac fibrosis or fibroblast activation. The compound has been extensively studied in oncology, which is consistent with its mechanism, but its effects in a cardiac fibrosis context are not documented in these databases.\\n\\nTherefore, the prediction is based on a strong mechanistic hypothesis rather than direct evidence. While the inhibition of HSP90 is a very plausible anti-fibrotic strategy, the lack of specific data for Luminespib in a relevant cardiac model necessitates a low confidence score.',\n",
