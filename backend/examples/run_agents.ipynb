I have searched for Luminespib in ChEMBL and found two entries: CHEMBL3137334 (LUMINESPIB MESYLATE) and CHEMBL252164 (LUMINESPIB). I then retrieved the compound properties for both. The properties are identical for both entries, indicating they refer to the same compound (Luminespib) with and without the mesylate salt. However, the ChEMBL search did not yield any direct information regarding Luminespib's efficacy in cardiac fibroblasts or fibrosis. Luminespib is known as an HSP90 inhibitor. While HSP90 plays a role in various cellular processes, including stress response and protein folding, there is no readily available preclinical data linking Luminespib specifically to the reversal of activated cardiac fibroblast phenotype or cardiac fibrosis. Without direct evidence from the literature or databases on its effect in this specific context, predicting a precise efficacy value is not possible. Therefore, I will assign a low predicted efficacy and low confidence.\",\n",
