Furthermore, HGF/Met signaling in cardiomyocytes is crucial for normal cardiac development and function, acting as an endogenous regulator of heart function through oxidative stress control, and plays a cardio-protective role in adult mice (3).', 'thought_4': 'The web search results indicate that activation of HGF/c-Met signaling is generally cardioprotective and *inhibits* the function of cardiac fibroblasts.

      "    reasoning='SU11274 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met/c-Met), with a reported IC50 of 20 nM. The signaling pathway initiated by the binding of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) to its receptor, c-Met, is known to be cardioprotective and has anti-fibrotic effects. Specifically in cardiac fibroblasts, activation of the HGF/c-Met pathway has been shown to inhibit their function. Since the goal of the assay is to reverse the \"failing\" phenotype (which is characterized by hyperactivity) to a more quiescent, \"nonfailing\" state, a compound that activates this pathway would be expected to be efficacious. However, SU11274 is an inhibitor of this pathway. By blocking the protective and anti-fibrotic HGF/c-Met signaling, SU11274 is expected to be ineffective or potentially even detrimental, preventing the fibroblasts from reverting to a nonfailing state. Therefore, it is predicted to have very low efficacy.',\n",
