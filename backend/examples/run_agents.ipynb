Inhibition of Hsp90, using geldanamycin or inhibitory peptides, has been shown to prevent signaling in profibrotic TGF-β cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. Additionally, Hsp90 inhibitors have been found to attenuate the development of cardiac fibrosis in mouse hypertrophy by suppressing the Calcineurin-NFAT and c-Raf-Erk pathways. Hsp90 inhibition also attenuates fibroblast migration and invasiveness, which are hallmarks of fibroblast activation.\\n\\nReferences:\\n- https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/am-pdf/10.1111/bph.15626\\n- https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.15626\\n- https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/21/3444\\n- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34016843/\\n- https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/91454'},\n",
      "    reasoning='Luminespib is a potent inhibitor of Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The provided evidence directly links Hsp90 activity to the activation of cardiac fibroblasts, the key process this assay aims to reverse. Specifically, Hsp90 is integral to pro-fibrotic signaling pathways, most notably the TGF-β pathway, which is a primary driver of fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Studies have demonstrated that inhibiting Hsp90 (using compounds like geldanamycin) can effectively block TGF-β signaling in cardiac fibroblasts, attenuate fibroblast migration and invasion, and reduce cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Given that Luminespib acts on this well-established, central pro-fibrotic mechanism, it is highly likely to reverse the activated morphological phenotype of the cardiac fibroblasts in the assay. The 10 µM concentration is expected to be sufficient for strong target engagement, leading to a significant shift in the cell population towards the desired \"nonfailing/quiescent-like\" state.',\n",
