Increases in various circulating hormones, cytokines, and proteins triggered by stress or injury contribute to fibroblast activation and differentiation and, ultimately, to cardiac fibrosis.7,8 Although many substances have been identified as playing a part in this process, several studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and endothelin (ET) are key elements in the cascade.\\n\\n\\n4.
