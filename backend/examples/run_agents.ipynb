      "    reasoning=\"Luminespib (CHEMBL252164) is a potent inhibitor of Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90B), with a reported IC50 of 7.0 nM. My investigation of Luminespib in both ChEMBL and PubChem databases found no direct experimental data related to cardiac fibrosis. The compound's development and the vast majority of its bioassay data are focused on oncology, where it has been tested in numerous cancer cell lines.\\n\\nHowever, a prediction can be made based on its mechanism of action. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone responsible for the stability and function of numerous client proteins, including many that are critical components of pro-fibrotic signaling pathways. Key pathways in cardiac fibrosis, such as the TGF-β pathway, rely on HSP90 to stabilize receptors and downstream signaling molecules like Smads. Therefore, inhibiting HSP90 is a plausible strategy to disrupt these pro-fibrotic cascades and potentially reverse the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition.\\n\\nThe screening assay uses a concentration of 10 uM. This is over 1000 times higher than the IC50 for HSP90 inhibition (7 nM) and also significantly higher than its GI50 (growth inhibition) concentration in cancer cell lines (e.g., 16 nM in HCT-116). At this high concentration, potent target engagement is virtually guaranteed. This concentration is also likely to be cytotoxic to the primary human ventricular fibroblasts, which would result in a reduced cell count and be interpreted as high efficacy in this assay format. Given the strong mechanistic rationale and the high concentration used, a significant reduction in active fibroblasts is expected, driven by a combination of specific anti-fibrotic effects and cytotoxicity.\",\n",
